# ddm_mediation
---

Simulate mediation data, and recover the mediation path parameters in a few ways.
For now, requires https://github.com/anne-urai/hddm.

#### ToDo
- vary a-path (regression of X onto M between subj)
- stick to drift bias-only models: does lavaan find the same direct vs indirect vs. partial mediation paths?
- then see if we can distinguish z vs. v
- last: fit MEG data with HDDMnn and compare models with and without collapsing bounds
